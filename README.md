# Project Description
Utilizing selenium an open-source tool in python that automates web browsers to collect data from a website called overbuff that houses data from the video game Overwatch. The main focus of this project was performing data collection using python and cleaning it up to be stored in Microsoft Excel. 

# About the Data
The data collected was retrieved from the "Heroes" tab on the overbuff website located [here](https://www.overbuff.com/heroes). The following tabs under the "Hero Stats" header were selected to retrieve the data.
  - Last 6 Months
  - PC, PSN, XBL, Switch
  - Quickplay, Competitive
  - ALL
  - ALL, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, GrandMaster
  - Overview, Primary, Eliminations, Medals

After collection the data was grouped into four different Excel sheets each containing 1,952 rows of Overwatch data.

# Important Things To Note About This Project
My inspiration for this project came about by the release of Overwatch 2. Since Overwatch 2 was launching that meant Overwatch was going to be taken offline for good and since I have had so many good memories with the game I decided to create this project. It is important to note that the data was collected a few days prior to Overwatch going offline and the website stopping data collection on Overwatch. This means the data I collected will differ from the data on the website by just a little bit. If the python script were to be re-ran it would collect the fresher data on the website.
